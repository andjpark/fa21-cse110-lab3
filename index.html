                <p><b>Follow up thoughts from meeting 1:</b></p>
                <p>As software engineers, we should strive to provide the best and most helpful experience to end users, rather than simply focusing on getting our product to work.<br>
                    Of course, we need our code to work, but coding should be the least of our worries; instead, we should provide a seemless experience. We code for humans, <i>not</i> for computers.
                </p>
                <p>Working in a strictly team environment, we cannot ignore our drastically different personalities and habits. Let's not assume that every other programmer is like us.<br>
                    We're all human, striving towards the same goals, so let's facilitate that. </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p><b>Summarized thoughts from meeting 2:</b></p>
                <p>For the best team working experience, we cannot only look to build our relationships and connections in the workplace, but <em>outside</em> of work, too. Facilitating a healthy<br>
                    dynamic between each other outside of work is keen to building strong team chemistry in order to better our workflow. 
                </p>
                <p>Let's start thinking of each other less as coworkers, and more as <em>teammates</em> and <em>humans</em>.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p><b>Unanswered questions and comments:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What if I simply do not get along with someone assigned to my team? What is the <strong>workaround our inherent incompatibility</strong>?</li>
                    <li>Would a strong friendship between two "teammates" be <strong>detrimental</strong> to the work produced?</li>
                    <li>If our lives and dynamics with each other are grounded upon the work we do, how can we <strong>ignore these boundaries</strong> when trying to establish a personal connection?</li>
                </ul>

                To be a good software engineer, you must first be a good <strong>human</strong>.
